## About Me :ghost:

I'm [Olivierodo](https://olivierodo.me), 15 years+ experienced as an engineer, API specialist and most recently maintainer of [RestQA](https://github.com/restqa/restqa).

[Check out my resume](https://github.com/olivierodo/Awesome-CV/releases/download/latest/olivier-rodomond.pdf) for more detail on my different skills.

## Story :mortar_board:

During my career I realized that, an engineer sharing what we learn is a key fundamental. It's an exercise that comes naturally with the experience.
Sometime we share perfectly and feel proud and sometime we might be more clumsy on how we share information. But at the end of the day it is another learning curve that we need to go through.
The best reward is when someone refer to you as their mentor without you noticing that you where mentoring them :heart:.

However with the time, i met a lot of people and shared a few different topic then i was able to identified a few key topics that people are constently asking me.

Then lately i decided to schedule session of 2 hours every week with one of my team member to do pair programming (the original intention was just for me to not loose track from the code base), but these session are ending up by amazing sharing session that my teamate are craving for.
This is how the concept is born, **what if i could team up with any one that would be interested by some of my skills ?**

Let's just try then, if you feel interested by any of my skill and want to learn from me. Give a try and [book a session](#book-a-sesssion-tada) :smile:.

## Concept :airplane: 

The concept is very simple:  __Learning with a Context = Hacking the learning curve__

Nowadays, internet is providing a LOT of content for self learning (udemy, youtube, medium, github, etc...)

However one important part that is missing is the context on how to use those fresh skills...  As human, the best way to remember what we just learned is to apply it into the right context.

This is why, I want to propose a new exclusive concept where I will dedicate my time on a pairing session with a student in order to solve some problematic related to a specific area.

During the session, I will prepare a feature that the student should contribute to and then learn by truly applying the fresh course to a real life context.

## How does it work ? :eyes:

### Session :kimono:

This is only remote session by call conference video. But you will have access to a development server prepared by myself especially for the session.

### Book a session  :calendar:

I am only proposing 1 session per week.
Book the session on my [calendar](https://calendly.com/olivierodo/pair-programming?month=2021-06)

### Duration :hourglass:

The duration of each session is 3 hours maximum.

### Language :microphone:

The session can be conduced in English :uk: or French :fr:

### Price :moneybag:

As the concept is stiil at a beta stage, the sessions are FREE.

In exchange I will ask your consent on recording the session for my personal promotion.

### Timezone :alarm_clock:

I'm currently living in Asia (bangkok: GMT+7).
