# Pair Programming with a Mentor

## Story :mortar_board:

I'm Olivier, 15 years+ experience engineer, API specialist and maintainer of [RestQA](https://github.com/restqa/restqa). [Check out my resume](https://github.com/olivierodo/Awesome-CV/releases/download/latest/olivier-rodomond.pdf)

During my career I realized that one of my favorite thing is to share what I know with everyone. Sometime from a clumsy way and sometime with a lot of impact.
And a long the way I realized that I became the mentor of someone just because they started to call me that way.

Across the time I was able to identify some key topics that people keeps asking me, and i felt that was it's time to create my Official Mentor course.

## Concept :airplane: 

Nowadays, internet is providing a LOT of content for learning (udemy, youtube, medium, github, etc...)

However one important part that is missing is the context on how to use the skills... 
And as human, the best way to remember what we learn is to apply it into the right context.

This is why, i want to propose a concept where you can come up an Pair with me in order to solve some problematic on topic that you are interested by

During the session, I will prepare a feature that you will be able to contribute then you will learn within a context with my support.

## How does it work ? :eyes:

### Session :kimono:

This is only remote session by call conference video. But you will have access to a development server prepared by myself especially for the session.

### Book a session  :calendar:

I am only proposing 1 session per week.
Book the session on my [calendar](https://savvycal.com/olivierodo/pair-learning)

### Duration :hourglass:

The duration for each session is set to 3 hours maximum.

### Language :microphone:

The session can be runned in English :uk: or French :fr:

### Price :moneybag:

The model is very simple, the first session is FREE however it will be recorded and could be reuse for personal content.

### Timezone :alarm_clock:

I'm currently living in Asia (bangkok: GMT+7).
